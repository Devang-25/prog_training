# Hands-on material for session 1
Three smaller exercises with examples and the mission.

## Small exercises

### Exercise 1

TBD

### Exercise 2

TBD

### Exercise 3
Create a simple calculator that takes two numbers as user input and returns a sum of these two numbers. The idea is that when the script is run in the terminal, the script will ask the user to provide first one number and then a second number, and use those two numbers for the calculation.

Example output:
```
$ python exercise3.py
Welcome! This application lets you calculate the sum of two numbers.
Enter the first number: 24
Enter the second number: 13
The sum of numbers 24 and 13 is 37
```

**Hint:**
Using input returns a string. To be able to calculate with the numbers, you need to change the datatype to int with int(). For example:
```python
number_as_a_string = input("What is your favourite number?")
number_as_a_number = int(number_as_a_string)
```

## Mission

The idea of the mission is to build a simple, working application during the training. We will start with some simple features, and continue working on the code in the next session. An example solution for the Mission 1 will be provided later.
